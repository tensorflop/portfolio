# Coursera Data Science Challenge
## Predict Customer Churn
This project was a competition put on by Coursera. It was a quick competition with only three days open for submissions. I achieved a result in the top 1% of all competitors.
### Challenge Description
The goal of this challenge was to predict the probability of customer churn for a streaming service. The performance metric for this challenge was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC). A train and test dataset were provided, with the training dataset containing labels for customer churn. The data description is shown in the table below.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This is where all projects start - EDA. I like to use ydata profiling, a Python package that can generate a pretty nice html report with one line of code.
